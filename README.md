# PhD_Study2

This repository holds code and data structure from my second PhD study that examined the relationship between athlete burnout and a number of health variables (depressive symptoms, sleep disruptions, life satisfaction, physical symptoms, illness symptoms) over three waves with a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM).  

For context, the published study (Glandorf et al., 2024) can be found here: https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/spy0000355 

The pre-registration as well as analysis code and data with codebook are also available on psycharchives. For licencing reasons, data can only be accessed from psycharchives.

Pre-registration: https://doi.org/10.23668/psycharchives.8214
Data: https://doi.org/10.23668/psycharchives.14066

Codebook and materials can be found under related objects to the data file.

The code for the modeling of the random-intercept panel model follows Mulder and Hamaker's paper (2020): https://doi.org/10.1080/10705511.2020.1784738

The repository associated with this paper can be found here: https://jeroendmulder.github.io/RI-CLPM/
