# PhD_Study2

This repository holds code and data from my second PhD study that examined the relationship between athlete burnout and a number of health variables (depressive symptoms, sleep disruptions, life satisfaction, physical symptoms, illness symptoms) over three waves with a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM).  

For context, the published study (Glandorf et al., 2024) can be found here: https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/spy0000355
The pre-registration as well as analysis code and data with codebook are also available on psycharchives: https://doi.org/10.23668/psycharchives.8214

The code for the modeling of the random-intercept panel model follows Mulder and Hamaker's paper (2020): https://doi.org/10.1080/10705511.2020.1784738
The repository associated with this paper can be found here: https://jeroendmulder.github.io/RI-CLPM/
